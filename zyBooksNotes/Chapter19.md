# Sets

## Set Abstract Data Type

Set - Collection of distinct elements

Add - Addes an element to the set, provided an equal element doesnt already exist

Key Value - primitive data value that serves as a unique identifier for the element

Sets distinguish elements based on key values

## Set Operations

Union - of sets X and Y denoted as X ∪ Y, is a set that contains every element from X, every element from Y, and no additional elements. Commutative

Intersection - of sets X and Y, denoted as X ∩ Y, is a set that contains every element that is in both x and y, and no addional elements. Commutative

Difference - of sets X and Y, denoted as X \ Y, is a set that contains every elements that is in X but not in Y, and no additional elemetns. Non-Commutative

Filter - produces a subset containing only elements from x that satisfy a particular condition

Filter Predicate - Filtering condition

Map - On set X produces a new set by applying some function to each element

## Static and Dynamic Set Operations

Dynamic Set - Set that can change after being constructed

Static Set - Set that cannot change after being constructed
